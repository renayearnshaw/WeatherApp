# WeatherApp
This project contains code I wrote while following [The Complete Node.js Developer](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-nodejs-developer-course-2) course by Andrew Mead

### Description
The __WeatherApp__ project is written using ES6/7 _JavaScript_ and uses _Express_ to create a simple _Node_ web server.
<br>The project contains a simple weather app that allows users to find the weather forecast for a given location. See https://earnshaw-renay-weather-app.herokuapp.com/.
<br>It is deployed using _Heroku_ and the _Heroku CLI_ (_Command Line Interface_) and uses:
1. The _Express_ module to create a web server that serves up web pages
2. _Handlebars_ dynamic templates and partials
3. The _fetch_ API to make a HTTP request from within the browser
4. _Promises_ - the fetch function returns a _Promise_
5. The _request_ module to make HTTP requests from within _Node_
